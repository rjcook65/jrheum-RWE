# jrheum-RWE
Code for reproducing large sample percent relative biases results from fitting naive Cox regression models from "The Use of Real-World Data for Studies of Dynamic Disease Processes"

## Simulations
Code to replicate simulation  
- script_limiting_values.R: Code to replicate large sample percent relative biases calculations for naive Cox regression models A-C
- limiting_values_expect_calc.R: Calculates limiting values of regression coefficient estimates for naive fitted Cox models
- func.gauleg.r: Performs Gauss Legendre Integration
- get_param.R: Functions used to derive and summarize setting parameters
